						Wait.<br>
						I thought I was looking at a UI/UX Design portfolio? Don’t worry - you are! My name is, in fact,
						Madison Haskins and I have never been able to figure out what I want to do with my life.
					</p>
					<p>
						So, you may be asking, “Madison, how did you get here?” Let me tell you. When I was in 5th grade I decided that I wanted to be a truck driver so I could see the world, and to my ten-year-old brain that meant that.  It didn’t matter that you cannot realistically drive an eighteen wheeler to Europe from the US. I sure wanted to try. I have never been very realistic, and I think this was the beginning of a very long journey to find my purpose in life.
					</p>
					<p>
						In case you were wondering, I changed my mind about the whole truck driver thing as I was growing up… weatherman, black jack dealer, an ordained minister, stage manager, waitress, receptionist and the list of odd jobs that I wanted goes on. But you know what they all have in common? They all do something to help create experiences for someone. When you watch a movie with a casino in it, are you focusing on the blackjack dealer? No, it’s about the players. When you watch a production at your local theatre, do you applaud the stage manager? Not typically. They are there to serve a specific purpose, to make the show go on without any hindrance to the viewer’s experience. Why should you tip your waitress? Because you just sat on your butt for an hour while they brought you stuff, and if they didn’t do that well enough you would document your bad experience on Yelp.
					</p>

					<p>
						If I’ve learned anything about myself since fifth grade, it’s that I’ve always been obsessed with experiences. Not with my own experience, though; my obsession is with helping someone else have the best experience. Back in college I had a capstone project for my Information Systems degree. We had to create a functional and fully editable web presence for the Searcy Parks and Recreation department. Could we have used Wordpress? Yes. Did I design and code the entire system myself instead? Yes. And I obsessed over it. I knew Wordpress would be too complicated so I created a very simple portal specifically for our stakeholders. Why? Because I’m obsessed with the experience.
					</p>
					<p>
						(Was it ever used? No. Life is full of disappointment but we keep on trucking - pun intended.)
					</p>
					<p>
						Even though I may not feel like I’m flourishing in my current position, I’ve had the opportunity to take the systems that I work with and create a better user experience. The system I work on is used by thousands of users from around the world everyday, but it’s new and different to them. To increase user acceptance I’ve implemented Walkme which lays over our web app and walks users though how to do use the features and perform their tasks. This has increased user acceptance by over half in just one quarter and decreased the amount of support hours required by our team by 45%. I also had the opportunity to create a new user interface for the app as well (you can find this under my work). I don’t view my professional career up until this point in time as a setback or a waste. I’ve truly tried to take my current role and use it as a springboard into my user experience career.
					</p>
					<p>
						These are just some of the events that pushed me in this direction but nevertheless I’m ready to make the switch. I have demonstrated skills in process learning, problem solving, and creating solutions through design. I have worked with different web programming languages and have a solid foundation in development. I’ve spent a lifetime of obsessing over user experience and I am looking forward to channeling that passion and my experiences into whatever role, product, or process that comes my way, except maybe not if it means becoming a truck driver.
