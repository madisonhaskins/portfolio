					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>Crystal Bridges is a well-known and world-renowned museum for American art located in my hometown of Bentonville, AR. I believe that Crystal Bridges is a hidden gem of Arkansas and because of my passion for it, I wanted my capstone project to center around Crystal Bridges. After visiting the website several times I realized that it should be the highlight of this project. The website itself is not particularly bad but I knew with the reputation of ‘world-renowned’ art museum to uphold - I though the website should mirror the beauty and creativity of the museum itself. </p>
					<h3>Problem</h3>
					<p>Below I’ve highlighted my MVPs. These are the things I thought could be improved on the site to improve the user experience and influence more people to visit.</p>

					<p>
						My MVPs are:
						<br>1) Simplify the navigation
						<br>2) Showcase Crystal Bridges branding
						<br>3) Showcase of the Art, Architecture, and Nature
					</p>

						<p>The main item that needed to be improved on the site is the navigation. When looking for something specific on the page, it is difficult to find exactly what you're looking for. There are a ton of nav items that pop up when you scroll over one of the 8 navigation headings.
							The next items have to do with with the overall Crystal Bridges branding. When in the museum Art, Architecture, and Nature are highlighted as the trifecta of what is important to the museum to showcase. I think it is important to communicate the same message through the website and highlight what is important.
						</p>

					<h3>Solution</h3>
					<p>With the problems identified - the solutions started to become more obvious:
						<br> - Combine pages to reduce nav items
						<br> - Determining exactly what information users are looking for
						<br> - Involve more photos of the museum and it’s activities on the first page
						<br> - Highlight Art, Architecture, and Nature as soon as the page loads

					<h3>Process</h3><br>
					<h5>User Testing</h5>
					<p>To begin to solve these problems and work toward the defined solutions it was important to start with research.
						My main goal through research was to get a better feel for what kind of information end-users are looking for and
						expecting when visiting a museum website.</p>
				<p>
					I created a user survey to gain insight into what people expect to find on a museum website. With that in mind I
					started looking into what other museum websites looked like. I picked 3 and did a competitive analysis and analyzed
					the design choices paying special attention to the layout and organization of their navigation, and the information present
					on the homepage. Leveraging the information form the competitive analysis and the user survey I determined there were 3 user personas.
					 I created a persona for a student researcher, a casual visitor, and a current member of the museum. Using these personas I defined some user
					  stories that would accomplish their goals. I further fleshed that out into user flows for how the users would play out their actions on the actual site.
				</p>
				<br>
					<h5>User Survey</h5>
					<p>
						With the 4 goal-oriented questions in mind I think there is some really good insight that I have gained from this user survey.
						My main objective was to see if people care about the museum website and if they did, what do they want to see when they access it.
						From the results of the survey it is pretty likely that someone will visit a museum website and it very likely that they will expect
						the design of the website to match the museum’s artistic nature. When they access the site they want to see things like current exhibits
						and a calendar of events alongside the more administrative information like hours of operation and location. When designing the new homepage
						for the Crystal Bridges site I think it is imperative that this information be in the fore-front and be prevalent enough that the user will not
						have to spend a lot of time searching for this information.</p>

						<section class="projectdesc row">
							<section class="large-6 columns">
									 <section class = "text-center">
										 <img src="images/museumsurvey.png" alt="" /><br><br>

							</section>
						</section>

						<p>From the <a href = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfqToR4J4T7kxHQay8E_612aLLSsZxvFU4E7HbVzFNIBUUycQ/viewform">survey</a> I have identified 3 personas:
							<br> - User doing research - Student
							<br> - Simply for information
							<br> - Wants to see current exhibits -  a Member
						</p>

						<br>
						<h5>User Personas</h5><br>

							</section>
						</section>
						<br>

					<h5>User Stories</h5>
					<p>Using the user research I needed to determine what is most important to our users.
						I ranked the highest desirables with insight from the survey and the competitive analysis.
						Using the feedback from the user survey ranking, the highest ranked were put into the highest priority ranking for the user stories.
						Those ranked medium and low priority are those more specific things a user would be searching for.</p>

						</section>
					</section>

					<h5>User Flows</h5>
					<p>The question to answer now is how do we accomplish these user stories?
						Using the identification of top priority functionality with the user stories and using user flows created when analyzing our competitors,
						the below user flows demonstrate the steps the user will take to complete a task</p>

					<h3>Information Architecture</h3><br>
					<h5>Wireframes</h5>
					<p>For this section I started by drawing out some wireframes for the site. I had about 50 museum websites pulled up and I used elements I liked from some of them to inspire the wireframes. I created wireframes for 5 of the pages that are in my user flows. With those wireframes I digitized them in Figma and further developed the placement of elements and navigation. I continued to draw inspiration from other museum websites. Finally I pulled some of the content from the Crystal Bridges website and put in in my content strategy. Because most of the content already exists I am leveraging what is already there for my content strategy.</p>

				<!-- Branding -->
				<section class = "large-12 column cssection" id = "branding">
					<h3>Brand Identity</h3>
					<p>Looking deeper into the current Crystal Bridges branding on the current site I noticed there were deviances in color from the 3 core brand colors. Some of the buttons used had a navy color and some had a green color that did not align with the green in the logo. I simplified the colors to be used on the site to the 3 main brand colors and some simplistic complimentary neutrals. I think simplifying the colors with work hand in hand with the overall simplification of the site. I did not rebrand the current logo but I did look at variations used on the site. I think changing the main logo to one of the simplified logos will align with my vision. Currently it is difficult to read the ‘museum of American art’ on the second line of text on the current logo. I also chose Muli as the font to be used for all of the text. I think it works well with the logo font and still gives a feeling of playfulness and fluidity but with more structure than the current font used.</p>

					<h3>Mockups</h3>
					<p>I started fleshing out the wireframes and added more content and photos. I also tried to limit the amount of color I used to let the photography be the focal point. I highlighted important sections like ‘On View’ and ‘Plan your Visit’ to draw the user to these sections. Each page features a different hero image. There is also some larger typography to play into the more artistic feel while not losing any functionality.</p>

					<h3>Additional Research - Navigation Card Sorting Exercise</h3>
					<p>One of the main reasons I wanted to take the Crystal Bridges website on was not because of a particularly bad visual design, but because of the confusing navigation. Coming this far into the project, and after working through the re-branding and visual design, now I wanted to take the time to break down the current navigation, determine what can go and what can stay, and allow potential end users the chance to categorize these items. The overarching goal is determining what users
					are expecting and then simplifying the navigation using their feedback. I will be accomplishing this by performing a hybrid of an open and closed card sorting exercise where there are predefined categories, but users can also define their own.</p>

					<br><h5>Current Navigation</h5><br>

					<a href = "https://x378gpg6.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/q5u81y1l"><h5>Card Sorting Exercise</h5></a><br>
					<h5>Card Sorting Analysis</h5>
					<p>Before importing my categories into the card sorting tool, I glanced over what the cards and noticed some things that could be adjusted. I removed Architecture as a category with it’s 3 nav items because the names would not mean anything to the participants in the survey. I also decided to combine the ‘Trails’ and ‘Trail Map’ line item for one unified page. I then elected to also remove the Nature category because it was already simplified. It’s important to note that the mission of Crystal Bridges is centered around ‘Art’, ‘Architecture’, and ‘Nature’. I already planned to highlight these nav categories by placing them in large font above a smaller nav bar (see bottom of page)</p>

					<p>After gathering some responses from the card sorting exercises performed, I began to see a common theme that helped my further organize the navigation for the new site. The standardization grid helped the most when analyzing this data. The biggest discoveries from the analysis were:
					Venue Rentals - originally ‘About’ -> 75% associated with ‘Visit’
					Library - originally ‘Art’ -> 75% associated with ‘Education’
					Research - originally ‘About’’ -> 100% associated with ‘Education’</p>

					<p>These 3 changes were made in the Revised Navigation Layout.</p>

					<h3>Conclusion</h3>
					<p>I’ve included the the original MVPs and their proposed solutions:
					<br> -Simplify the navigation
					<br> -Showcase Crystal Bridges branding
					<br> -Showcase of the Art, Architecture, and Nature
					<br>
					<br> -Combine pages to reduce nav items
					<br> -Determining exactly what information users are looking for
					<br> -Involve more photos of the museum and it’s activities on the first page
					<br> -Highlight Art, Architecture, and Nature as soon as the page loads
					</p>
					<p>I used my user survey additional research to determine what information was important to the user, then used the card sorting exercise to organize and combine the content. I also used photography with a simplistic design so that the brand of Crystal Bridges is highlighted and stand out immediately. The nav bar was created with a visual hierarchy that highlights the Art, Architecture, and Nature links first before the other navigation content. THis is both function but also communicates the brand.</p>

					<p>Through this process a new web presence for Crystal Bridges was created. It’s purpose is to draw the user’s attention to the museum and intrigue visitors to want to share in the experience that the museum creates.</p>
